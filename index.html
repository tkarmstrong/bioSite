            <p class="mt-0">Nick is 36 years old and is from Tennessee. Nick graduated from high school in 2001 and decided that he wanted to join the Air Force.  Nick left for Basic Military Training in the summer of 2001.  After graduating from boot camp, he transferred to Sheppard AFB, TX to Technical Training where he learned all about the weapons systems on the F-16 Fighting Falcon.  After graduating from tech school, Nick transferred to Mountain Home AFB, ID to begin his new trade as a Weapons Troop.</p>
            <p>Nick worked on all facets of the F-16 weapons systems.  He was responsible for repairing all the electrical systems so that when the pilot pushed the fire button, the weapon of choice would release.  He was a "three man" meaning he also drove the bomb lift truck used to load bombs and missiles on the jet.</p>
            <p>Nick traveled to several locations during his tour in the military.  His fondest place was to South Korea where he was involved in a military exercise.  While there he got to sightsee many places and visit Japan to help repair a jet that broke down.</p>
            <p>Nick completed his tour in the Air Force and moved back home.  He went to Barber School and became a Master Barber.  After barbering for a little while, Nick decided to open his barbershop.  He operated a successful business for over ten years and after meeting the love of his life; Nick chose to seek another career change.  Nick now works for State Farm as a Producer.</p>

            <img src="./images/family/nick_heather.jpg" alt="Photo of Nick and Heather">
            <p class="mt-0">Nick has been with his wife Heather now for nearly ten years, and their marriage is going on three years.  Nick and Heather have two dogs.  A German Sheppard named Abel, and a Pomeranian named Pepper.  </p>
            <p>Nick is an only child but considers his best friend Tyler as his brother. In fact, the entire idea behind this site was to cause Nick some mental discomfort. Tyler looks forward to the big unveiling at the end of the course.</p>      
            <p>Nick and Tyler met in 2002 while serving together in the Air Force and have been friends ever since.  Tyler's daughter even refers to Nick as "Uncle Nick" because of how close of friends they have become over the years.  Being in the military can be difficult being stationed away from family.  It was not uncommon for Tyler to spend holidays with Nick's family due to the difficulties of travel and logistics.</p>
